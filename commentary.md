Option A

In Chapter 30, section 3, Hyginus uses the ablative absolute *Minerva monstrante* in order to interject the presence of Minerva and her aid of Hercules into this description of the deed. 
I found this use of the ablative absolute interesting as it allowed Hyginus to add this key detail of the story in without disrupting the flow of, or overcomplicating, the sentence. 
Another choice of Hyginus's that interested me was his use of the deponent *iaculabantur* in Chapter 30, Section 6. I appreciated his use of this deponent as its passive form yet active meaning as it adds to the sentence not only the action of the birds as given by means of using a relative clause, but also despite their active action, the passive formed deponent removes them from the active action and sets them as lesser to the subject of the sentence, Hercules.
