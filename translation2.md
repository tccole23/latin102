A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

B. Grammatical questions
Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?) - the antecedent is flumen and it's masculine, singular. It is in the dative case becasue it is referencing what the action is impacting

Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose. - It is in the infinitive - I placed it in that clause because it is a complementary infinitive

sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. 
Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). - singular, perfect passive, feminine, accusative
Find the dictionary entry for this word in the Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here. - urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n45939❌ (correction -urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n48489 )

Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case? - dative (correciton - ablative) - ❌ (correction - because it's describing the means of the action) because it's describing who is being peirced by them (the arrows)

Identify the form of moriens. - singular, present active, masculine, nominative

Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case? - ablative - because it's describing what is happening❌ (correction - because it's describing what the arrows were dipped in)

Identify the form of tinctas. - plural, perfect passive, feminine, accusative

Identify the form of exceptum. - singular, perfect passive, masculine, accusative

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. 
In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. 
Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

As I lay dying - Interficienti ❌ (moriens)

Translation:

Deianira, the wife of Hercules, could not cross a great river, which was called Evenus, and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixiunis and Nubis, for help. After she was lifted from the river, he wanted to rape her. When Hercules came there, Deianira begged for his help, and he peirced Nessum (Nessus - correction)❌ with his arrows. 

As he was dying, he knew that the arrows were soaked in the Hydra Lernaeae's venom and held its power, so he took out his blood and gave it to Deianira and said it was a love potion.
