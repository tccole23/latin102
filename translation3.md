C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. 
Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

One choice Hyginus makes that I found interesting was his use of the ablative absolute, *flumine admisso*, as it adds more information to how he cleaned the stables in such a short amount of time. The other choice I liked that Hyginus made was his use of the relative pronoun and clause with: *qui carne humana vescebantur*. This is because it once again is able to add more specifics and detail to the story so we as readers have a full picture of the scene. I appreciate these additions as it goes past the bones of the story and fleshes out the story.

Translation:

In one day he cleaned the dung and stable of King Ageas, Iuppiter helped for the most part; he admitted the river to wash away all of the dung. The bull which Pasipha laid with, he led out of the island of Crete to Mycenae. He killed Diomedes, King of Thrace, and his four horses, which ate human flesh, with the slave Abderus; the horses were named Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.
